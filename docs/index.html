 In the novel “All quiet on the western front”, Erich Maria Remarque (the author) uses Paul as the protagonist and the narrator of the story. Through Paul’s point of view, War appears to destroy everything and kills everybody before it even kills them. 

</p>
<p>
 Paul used to love and write poetry: “... there lies the beginning of a play called “Saul” and bundle of poems. Many an evening I have worked over them”(Page 9). Because of the war, horror, Paul can not write it anymore : “but that has become so unreal to me I cannot comprehend it any more.”  
</p>
<p>
The war forces him to forget about his emotion, his mind to use the animal instinct in order to survive, live for another day: “By the animal instinct that is awakened in us we are led and protected. It is not conscious; it is far quicker, much more sure, less fallible, than consciousness. One cannot explain it” (Chapter 4). Therefore, he lost his feelings, he does not mourn for his comrades who he is not closed to. He does not feel like home when he received a break from the army: “But the sense of strangeness will not leave me, I cannot feel at home amongst these things” (Page 72, chapter 7). 

</p>
<p>
 Even though Paul claims that war destroys him in his emotion, he seems to be sensitive with the outside world and somewhat human-like. He thinks of the prisoners and feel sad for them: “A word of command has made these silent figures our enemies; a word of command might transform them into our friends.” (Chapter 8), He also feel bad after killing a french man: “But you're just a man like me, and I killed you. We only wanted to live, you and I. Why should they send us out to fight each other? If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms, you could be my brother, just like Kat and Albert” because they are also innocent that was forced to join the war where everybody is a devil: “Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours, and that we have the same fear of death, and the same dying and the same agony—Forgive me, comrade; how could you be my enemy?” (Chapter 9).

</p>
<p>
 Paul’s death in the last chapter is …  represents a lost generation where when war is over, nobody remembers and nobody can understands. He, once tried everything to live but when thought he succeed in surviving, he failed. He lost every of his friends whose he loves the most and did not feel the point of life anymore.
</p>
<p>
 Through his perspectives, people can see the horror of war which can not describe in words if nobody has been through: he cannot tell hó mother what war is like because she will never understand: “Mother, what should i answer to that! You would not understand, you could never realize it. And you shall never realize it” (Page 72), the horror that war left behind on men and people even when they win or lost which only profit the government.

  <p>
From the begins to end, from a person who tries everything to survive, to keep his friend from dying; at the end of the novel, when the war ends, when thought everything Paul was doing to keep him alive succeeded, he wants to die and in fact, he dies with a calm face: “his face had an expression of calm, as though almost glad the end had come” (Chapter 12, page 133). This conflict shows how war takes away everything from him: his hobbies, his childhood, his friends and his emotion as well as other soldiers those are involved. In Addition, this conflict also shows how inconsistent people are. Once people achieve something, they want the other.

 After days and days in the front, seeing the horror of war, kills and deaths, Paul returns home from a  few days - beak. His mom wants him to tell her what war is like. Unfortunately, He can not express it: “Mother, what should i answer to that! You would not understand, you could never realize it. And you shall never realize it” (Page 72). Through his action and his thoughts throughout the story and with his mother, people can relate to themselves that if people have not been through something or doing something, they will never and shall never understand what it is like to be in that situation. He cannot tell his mom how the war is, he refers to his generation in the last chapter as the “Lost generation.”. He dies in vain but happy because he knows that after the war, nobody can understand him. 

</p>
<p>
The war destroy everything that it goes through, does not matter if they are a soldier or just an innocent people. The novel “Night” of Elie Wiesel give people the point of view of an innocent child who has to face the war. In both novel, even though they are in two period of time (WWI and WWII) with two different perspectives (as a soldier and as a child, innocent people), the image of how war makes people become animal appears explicitly. In the novel “Night”, people in the train act like animal, they do not think, they just do whatever they feel and whatever they want to.  With the soldier, they have to use animal instinct to stay alive: “By the animal instinct that is awakened in us we are led and protected. It is not conscious; it is far quicker, much more sure, less fallible, than consciousness. One cannot explain it” (Chapter 4 - All quiet on the Western front). Not only to stay alive, they have to disconnect their mind with their emotions to fight and to not feel pain.

</p>
<p>
 The war only benefit one side not the people in the winning side, not the people in the losing side but the government or the commander that has the political power, the idea of nationalism to draft, push man to war just to solve political conflicts with another country. They are not the person who directly goes to war so they do not care and will never care. In the story, there are two characters: Kantorek and Himmelstoss, because they have power, they can abuse them but in fact, they are worthless in the battle field. Some of Paul’s friend join the army because Katorek - the teacher force them to for a simple  reason: showing love to the nation: “There were thousands of Kantoreks, all of whom were convinced that they were acting for the best - in a way that cost them nothing”(Chapter 1, page 6). Paul fights, kills for him to survive. Moreover, Paul and his friends think that the real enemies is the nation, who Paul and other people are fighting for.

The boot is a symbolic image of the war which is passed through generations of soldier. From Kemmerich to Muller ( after Kemmerich’s death ): “Muller can make good use of them. Kemmerich will die” (Chapter 2) and from Muller to Paul. The boot represents the most valuable property of a soldier and it might even be more valuable and durable than soldiers themselves. The boot also appears in the scene where Paul meets the Russian prisoners: “They exchange whatever they possess for bread. Often they have fair success, because they have very good boots and our are bad.”  (Chapter 8 ). The prisoners exchange their boots for their lives that keep them from starving.
